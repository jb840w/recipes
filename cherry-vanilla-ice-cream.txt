1 can of Eagles Brand condensed milk
3 cups of sugar
2 tsp flour
1/2 gallon of milk
marachino cherries sliced (you decide how many)
pour some of the cherry juice into your mixture (not scientific, maybe a 1/3)
1 tbsp vanilla extract

* instructions for preparing the home-made ice cream vary, I prefer using an ice
   cream machine.  Some might prefer to stick it in the freezer.
